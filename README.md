# FinTrinity

This is a GUI that allows you to use the Trinity Playstation Vita hack by TheOfficialFloW without much effort.

**This is still very much a work in progress**

If you do use this, PLEASE make a backup of your game folder first.

This is currently only for Windows. I have tested it with Windows 10 and the latest version of QCMA (v0.4.1)

To use it, you will need to have [python 3.7.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed and in your path. If you
download it and run through the installer, you should be good to go. Make sure you select to add it to your path as it
is not default. After you have python 3.7 installed, you should be able to download this git repository as a zip and
double click on FinTrinity.py.


# Testing

If it works for you, please let me know. If you're interested in helping me figure out how to make it work for macOS and
Linux, let me know.

Thanks!
